        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>JaKobi Burton was born in Indianapolis, IN, and has a Bachelor of Arts in Industrial and Mechanical Technology from Indiana State University.</p>
        <p>JaKobi joined the Indiana African American Genealogy Group after attending his 1st genealogy conference in Oct 2014. Like his father, he has always been interested in history. Under the tutelage of Tonya Hull, he began to build a solid foundation in genealogical research. Monthly DNA Group meetings led by Charles Barker and presentations by members of Central Indiana DNA Interest Group proved to be an inspiring combination. DNA analysis and genetic genealogy quickly became his primary focus.</p>
        <p>After years of designing utility trucks for domestic and international customers, in August 2023 JaKobi adjusted his focus to traverse a more personally fulfilling and rewarding career path. He is currently pursuing a graduate degree in Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University Bloomington.  To supplement his studies, JaKobi became a research consultant for Purdue University's <a href="https://scalek12.org" target="_blank">SCALE K-12</a> research project in September 2023. In addition to being a grad student, he is a genealogical research consultant for his first independent business venture, Enigmatic Enterprises Inc.  He plans to offer fee-based genealogical services to help others gain knowledge about their ancestors.</p>
